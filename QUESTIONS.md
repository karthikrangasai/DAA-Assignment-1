- Does _set_ means a literal mathematical set or we have to swap in other available Data Structures?

- Does the partition function require us to generate pairs of y values (y1, y2) such that
	- _all possible pairs_ of y values satisfying y1 < y2 are created,
    - or pairs of the form (i, i+1), since this way all values of y are either <= y1 or >= y2?

- In the _x-proj_ and _intervals_ functions, what do we use to define intervals from coordinates?
	- Do we require the fact that a _coordinate_ belongs to a rectangle?
